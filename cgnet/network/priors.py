    Parameters
    ----------
    callback_indices: list of int

        layer through a residual connection

    interaction_parameters : list of python dictionaries
        list of dictionaries that specify the constants characterizing

        numerical values. The order of these dictionaries follows the same order
        as the callback indices specifying which outputs from the feature layer
        should pass through the prior. The strucutre of interaction_parameters

        In this way, _PriorLayer may be subclassed to make arbitray prior
        layers based on arbitrary interactions between bead tuples.

    Attributes
    ----------
    interaction_parameters: list of dict
        each list element contains a dictionary of physical parameters that
        characterizxe the interaction of the associated beads. The order of
        this list proceeds in the same order as self.callback_indices
    callback_indices: list of int
        indices used to access a specified subset of outputs from the feature
        layer through a residual connection

    Examples
    --------
    To assemble the feat_dict input for a HarmonicLayer prior for bonds from an
    instance of a stats = GeometryStatistics():

    bonds_interactions, _ = stats.get_prior_statistics('Bonds', as_list=True)
    bonds_idx = stats.return_indices('Bonds')
    bond_layer = HarmonicLayer(bonds_idx, bonds_interactions)

    Notes
    -----
    callback_indices and interaction_parameters MUST share the same order for
    the prior layer to produce correct energies. Using
    GeometryStatistics.get_prior_statistics() with as_list=True together with
    GeometryStatistics.return_indices() will ensure this is True for the same
    list of features.

    The units of the interaction paramters for priors must correspond with the
    units of the input coordinates and force labels used to train the CGnet.

    ----------

        dictionaries are 'ex_vol', the excluded volume (in length units), and

        decay with distance.

    Attributes
    ----------
    repulsion_parameters : torch.Tensor
        tensor of shape [2, num_interactions]. The first row contains the
        excluded volumes, the second row contains the exponents, and each
        column corresponds to a single interaction in the order determined
        by self.callback_indices

    Notes
    -----
    This prior energy should be used for longer molecules that may possess
    metastable states in which portions of the molecule that are separated by
    many CG beads in sequence may nonetheless adopt close physical proximities.
    Without this prior, it is possilbe for the CGnet to learn energies that do
    not respect proper physical pairwise repulsions. The interaction is modeled
    after the VDW interaction term from the classic Leonard Jones potential.

    Notes
    -----
    This prior energy is useful for constraining the CGnet potential in regions
    of configuration space in which sampling is normally precluded by physical
    harmonic constraints associated with the structural integrity of the protein
    along its backbone. The harmonic parameters are also easily estimated from
    all atom simulation data because bond and angle distributions typically have
    Gaussian structure, which is easily intepretable as a harmonic energy
    contribution via the Boltzmann distribution.
